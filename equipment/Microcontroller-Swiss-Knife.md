**Team Members (1-4 suggested): Only me, @otus9051, at this point**

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good): Yep**

**What you are making? A tiny computer which does a lot of things**

**Inspiration: The Swiss Army Knife**

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works): Not yet, but as far as I am concerned, it will just be a PCB with an LCD/OLED and a keyboard, and a battery.**

Idea is to get a single microcontroller/microprocessor even, and putting as many things on there as possible.
Current Ideas:
  - LoRaWAN Pager and Node
  - GPS & Compass
  - SOS Capabilities (possibly based on LoRaWAN)
  - Emulated WiFi Hotspot (for sharing files)
      - Could make an app which would enable exposing a part of your filesystem as an HTTP server
  - E-book Reader
      - Could include things like survival guides or emergency documentation (for a lack of better words) if someone does get lost
      - Including resources for emergency contacts and whatnot
  - Camera
      - Would make this a high-cost device due to the inclusion of a colour LCD, but would integrate well with the emulated WiFi Hotspot

Executing the Ideas:
Current contenders for possible microcontroller/processors are:
  1. ESP8266/32
  2. Allwinner F1C100S/200S
  3. Amlogic S905X2/3 (Warning, High Price)
  4. Allwinner H3
  5. Allwinner V3s
  6. Anything based on ARM Cortex M0/M0+/M3
